Day trade bitcoin via Mt. Gox.

## PROJECT ABANDONED

I never completed this. Feel free to submit a pull request if you want to. :-)

I had intended to use the fact that Bitcoin is so volatile to make some extra cash. The idea was that
it would notify me whenever the price of a Bitcoin went up (or down) by a certain multiple of the standard
deviation. Not a very sophisticated algorithm, but enough for me (as a human) to just look at what was going
on and make a decision.

Most of the plumbing is there. It depends on the node module that I wrote for Mt. Gox.

It doesn't work on other Bitcoin exchanges.

Enjoy!
